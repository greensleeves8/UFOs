# UFOs
UFO sighting data with JavaScript

## Overview

Dana is a data journalist writing about her hometown, McMinnville, Oregon, a well-known hub 
for UFO activity. We were tasked with a helping her create a web page with a table of UFO 
encounters that can be filtered to search by different criteria stored within the table. To 
accomplish this we relied on HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. 

## Results

The web page allows the user to search by date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO 
craft individually, and the user can also combine any of those criteria in a search to further
refine their search. Rather than having a button that launches the filtered search, the table 
reacts upon input being entered into the search box. The following screenshots will demonstrate
the different criteria one can filter by.

And finally, all of the search criteria combined:

## Summary 

One potential drawback of the current search design is due to the size of the current UFO
sighting dataset that we are using. Because of the relatively small size of the dataset, it
relatively easy to refine the search too far and have no results show up. Also, the user doesn't
really know what criteria will return a valid search. One potential solution to this would be 
to have a dropdown feature in the search box that'd allow the user to select valid criteria in
each search parameter. Another recommendation I would make would be to have the table have a link
to a news source or account of each sighting when applicable, so the user can expand their 
research into any particular event they may be curious about.
